# Dumppi

Dumppi is a cross-platform freeride ski forecast app. It visualizes 7-day snow accumulation as heatmaps and overlays wind vectors on topographic maps to help skiers find the best powder.

## Architecture
- Framework: Flutter (iOS, Android, Web)
- Weather API: Open-Meteo (free, high-resolution)
- Maps: flutter_map with OpenSnowMap tiles
- State: Provider + ChangeNotifier

## File Structure
- lib/features/       - Feature modules (forecast, favorites, map)
- lib/core/           - Shared utilities, API clients
- lib/data/           - Data sources, repositories
- lib/presentation/   - UI widgets and screens

## Key Decisions
- Dynamic viewport-based grid fetching (fetch weather for visible map area)
- Local caching for offline access at resorts
- Vector wind arrows for lee-side loading visualization

## How to Extend
1. Add new data sources in lib/data/sources/
2. Create new map overlays in lib/features/map/layers/
3. Add resort database entries in assets/resorts.json
